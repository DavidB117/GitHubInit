# GitHubInit

A simple command line tool that streamlines the setup of a Node project.

## Getting Started

- Be sure to have NodeJS 12 or greater installed on your machine.
- Run `npm install -g` in the project directory to install this project as a global node module on your machine.
- Run `npm ls -g --depth=0` to confirm the install worked.
- Now you can run the command `githubinit` in any directory to run this tool and set up a Node/GitHub project.
- If you need to uinstall the app, run `npm uninstall -g` in the project directory to remove it from your global node modules.

## TODO

- [ ] Set up ability to log in with a GitHub account that uses 2FA.
- [ ] Solve issue with deprecated package @octokit/auth-basic
